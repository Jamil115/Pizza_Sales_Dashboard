# Pizza Sales Dashboard (Excel Project)

This is my first data analysis project using Microsoft Excel. The goal was to explore and analyze pizza sales data to generate insights and build a fully interactive dashboard using pivot tables and charts.


## Project Overview

Using a raw dataset of pizza orders, I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and visualization â€” all within Excel. The final dashboard highlights key trends, customer preferences, and pizza performance metrics.


## Project Structure

- **Dataset:**  
  Contains the raw pizza sales data without any preprocessing.

- **Augmented Dataset:**  
  Includes EDA and feature engineering steps to prepare the data for analysis.

- **Pivot Table & Charts:**  
  Summary tables created using pivot tables and visualized using pivot charts.

- **Dashboard:**  
  An interactive Excel dashboard showing sales trends, category performance, and top/worst-performing pizzas.


## Key Highlights

- Identified peak sales periods through daily and hourly order analysis  
- Analyzed sales by pizza category and size to understand customer preferences  
- Highlighted the top 5 best-selling pizzas for targeted promotions  
- Identified the 5 lowest-selling pizzas to guide potential menu changes
